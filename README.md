# Bach-Compiler
The Bach Compiler is a full compiler built from scratch for the Bach programming language. It was implemented using JLex for lexical analysis, JavaCup for parsing, and Java for semantic checks and code generation. The compiler translates Bach source code into MIPS assembly, which can be executed on a MIPS simulator.

This project was developed as part of a compiler construction course and provided hands-on experience with language design, parsing, type systems, and code generation.
